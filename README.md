# 📚 Setel Payment Service

 Main feature: Responsible for payments management.

# 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Environment required: NodeJS > 10.20

#### Non Docker

- Please make sure to either have MongoDB Community installed locally or a subscription to Mongo on the cloud by configuration a cluster in [atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas). 

#### Docker 🐳

- Please make sure to have docker desktop setup on any preferred operating system to quickly compose the required dependencies. Then follow the docker procedure outlined below.

**Note**: Docker Desktop comes free on both Mac and Windows, but it only works with Windows 10 Pro. A workaround is to get [Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/) which will bypass the Windows 10 Pro prerequisite by executing in a VM.

## Technical stack

- Technical programming:
  - *Language*: **NodeJS, Typescript**
  - *Framwork*: **NestJs**
  - Task-runner: **Gulp**
  - *Testing*: **Jest**
- Technical operation:
  - *Containerize*: all application containerize with **Docker**
  - *Orchestration*: **K8S**, Kops
  - *Package manager*: **Helm**
  - *CI/CD*: **Bitbucket pipeline**
  - *Cloud*: **AWS**

### 🚀 Deployment

You can launch applications with many different environment modes like:

- **Local**: running with local environment. Application mode running in port: **3000**

  ```shell
  # install: yarn
  # running: yarn start
  ```

### ✅ Testing

#### Docker 🐳

```bash
# unit tests
$ docker exec -it nest yarn test

# e2e tests
$ docker exec -it nest yarn test:e2e

# test coverage
$ docker exec -it nest yarn test:cov
```

#### Non-Docker

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```

- For **staging** & **production** environments, you cannot run it on your local server. This is because configs for these environments are used under *configmap* and *secret* on our *K8S infrastructure*. Note that for staging environment you can access the document-api link that we have implemented below

  ```bash
  
  ```
